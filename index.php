	<p>1914 translation by H. Rackham</p>

	"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing 
	pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete 
	account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great 
	explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one 
	rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, 
	but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally 
	encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there 
	anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because 
	it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and 
	pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which 
	of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some 
	advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who 
	chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one 
	who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

	<h3>BEST of the WEST! Destinations!</h3>

	"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and 
	dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms 
	of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot 
	foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal 
	blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of 
	will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and 
	pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In 
	a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when 
	nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every 
	pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.  The wise man therefore always 
	holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects 
	pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures 
	pains to avoid worse pains."
    	but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
